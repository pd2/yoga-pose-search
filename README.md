Here is my latest simple web game based on searching a word in jumbled up letters.

Your challenge is to search for English names of the yoga poses (asanas) in a grid of letters. This is a fun way to think about the different poses that each asana makes.

Just like the Aasanas themselves, the English words, that the pose represents (object), can also be in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, either forward or in in reverse order on the grid.
